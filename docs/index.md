# Assignment 1

## Foundations of Deep Learning Pipelines and Architectures

**Sole author:** Nguyen Minh Quang · 2453052

Nguyen Minh Phuc and Nguyen Thanh The are members of the course project, but
they did not contribute to Assignment 1.

This assignment compares Linear, MLP, CNN, GRU, and Transformer classifiers on
Fashion-MNIST under a shared split and evaluation protocol.

# Assignment 2

## Deep Learning on Large-Scale Data and Specialized Tasks

**Task track:** image classification on Food-101 (101 classes, 101,000 images).  
**Status:** M3 Final complete; report, slides, and presentation video published.

Three adaptation regimes plus a matched frozen control were trained on the same 68,175/7,575/25,250 split and evaluated once on the official 25,250-image test set:

| Run | Model | Adaptation | Test accuracy | Test macro-F1 |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| E1 | Simple CNN | Scratch | 51.96% | 51.21% |
| E2 | ResNet-50 | Frozen backbone | 66.70% | 66.36% |
| A0 | ResNet-50 | Frozen, E3 protocol (control) | 61.71% | 60.88% |
| E3 | ResNet-50 | Full fine-tuning | **86.17%** | **86.10%** |

## AI Usage Disclosure

Generative-AI use is disclosed on the landing page, each assignment page, each report, and in the repository log. The models and reported metrics were trained and verified by the group on Kaggle GPUs; AI assistance was limited to scaffolding, documentation, visualization scripts, and consistency checks. See [AI_USAGE.md](https://github.com/tapstoptap/deep-learning-261/blob/main/AI_USAGE.md) for per-entry prompts, affected files, verification, and the responsible member.
